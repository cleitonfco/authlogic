module Authlogic
  module Session
    # Between these callbacks and the configuration, this is the contract between me and
    # you to safely modify Authlogic's behavior. I will do everything I can to make sure
    # these do not change.
    #
    # Check out the sub modules of Authlogic::Session. They are very concise, clear, and
    # to the point. More importantly they use the same API that you would use to extend
    # Authlogic. That being said, they are great examples of how to extend Authlogic and
    # add / modify behavior to Authlogic. These modules could easily be pulled out into
    # their own plugin and become an "add on" without any change.
    #
    # Now to the point of this module. Just like in ActiveRecord you have before_save,
    # before_validation, etc. You have similar callbacks with Authlogic, see the METHODS
    # constant below. The order of execution is as follows:
    #
    #   before_persisting
    #   persist
    #   after_persisting
    #   [save record if record.has_changes_to_save?]
    #
    #   before_validation
    #   before_validation_on_create
    #   before_validation_on_update
    #   validate
    #   after_validation_on_update
    #   after_validation_on_create
    #   after_validation
    #   [save record if record.has_changes_to_save?]
    #
    #   before_save
    #   before_create
    #   before_update
    #   after_update
    #   after_create
    #   after_save
    #   [save record if record.has_changes_to_save?]
    #
    #   before_destroy
    #   [save record if record.has_changes_to_save?]
    #   after_destroy
    #
    # Notice the "save record if has_changes_to_save" lines above. This helps with performance. If
    # you need to make changes to the associated record, there is no need to save the
    # record, Authlogic will do it for you. This allows multiple modules to modify the
    # record and execute as few queries as possible.
    #
    # **WARNING**: unlike ActiveRecord, these callbacks must be set up on the class level:
    #
    #   class UserSession < Authlogic::Session::Base
    #     before_validation :my_method
    #     validate :another_method
    #     # ..etc
    #   end
    #
    # You can NOT define a "before_validation" method, this is bad practice and does not
    # allow Authlogic to extend properly with multiple extensions. Please ONLY use the
    # method above.
